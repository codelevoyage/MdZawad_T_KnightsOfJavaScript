# ⚔️ Simple Turn-Based Fighting Game

A basic two-player fighting game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ✅ What I Implemented

- Players take turns attacking each other.
- Active player's button is red, inactive player's button is grey.
- Health decreases randomly each turn (1–25).
- Health never goes below 0.
- Attack and damage animations added for both players.
- Sound effect plays when damage is taken.
- Dungeon background image added to the whole page.
- Text elements styled for better visibility.
